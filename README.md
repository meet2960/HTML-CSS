# HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery

This Repository contains basic projects created with HTML and CSS. The Projects are fully built from scratch and fully responsive. I have used CSS Framework like Bootstrap and with little custom CSS in each project. I Have used some vanilla javascript for some basic functionalities in each project depending upon the need.

Here I have a list of projects with Live Link.
